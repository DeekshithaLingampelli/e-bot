"Hello, and welcome to our project . Today, we’ll be demonstrating our eCommerce chatbot, designed to enhance the shopping experience by providing instant support and assistance to customers. We've developed this chatbot using Dialogflow, MySQL Workbench, PyCharm, and FastAPI."

### 2. Overview of Technologies Used
"Let's start with an overview of the technologies we used:
- *Dialogflow:* For natural language understanding and conversation management.
- *MySQL Workbench:* For managing our product and order database.
- *PyCharm:* Our integrated development environment where we write and manage our code.
- *FastAPI:* A modern web framework for building APIs with Python, used to handle backend logic and manage API endpoints."

### 3. Architecture and Workflow
"Our chatbot architecture consists of three main components:
1. *User Interaction:* Users interact with the chatbot via a web interface or messaging platform.
2. *Dialogflow:* Processes user inputs to understand their intent and extract relevant entities.
3. *Backend (FastAPI and MySQL):* FastAPI handles requests from Dialogflow, interacts with the MySQL database to fetch or update information, and returns the response to Dialogflow, which then replies to the user.
Here’s a detailed workflow:
- When a user types a query, Dialogflow identifies the user’s intent and sends a webhook request to our FastAPI server.
- FastAPI processes this request, interacts with the MySQL database as needed, and sends the response back to Dialogflow.
- Dialogflow formats the response and sends it back to the user."

### 4. Demonstration of Key Features


Feature 1: Product Search
"We’ll start with a product search. Users can type queries like 'Show me laptops under 100000'. The chatbot processes this request, and based on the query, it is designed to return a list of matching products."



Feature 2: Order Tracking
"Next, we have order tracking. Users can enter their order number to get updates on their order status. The chatbot is configured to retrieve this information from our database and display it to the user."

Feature 3: FAQs and Customer Support
"Our chatbot can handle frequently asked questions and provide customer support. For example, users can ask about return policies, and the chatbot will provide the relevant information."


### 5. Technical Details

Dialogflow Setup
"In Dialogflow, we defined several intents and entities to handle different types of user queries. For example, our 'ProductSearch' intent includes training phrases like 'Show me smartphones under $500' and parameters to capture product categories and price ranges."


FastAPI Endpoints
"On the backend, we set up FastAPI to handle various endpoints. For instance, our product search endpoint is designed to receive a query from Dialogflow, search the database using a SQL query, and return the results."

Database Queries
"We use MySQL to store and manage our product and order data. Here’s an example of a SQL query that retrieves products based on user input."

### 6. Challenges and Solutions
"Throughout this project, we encountered several challenges, such as handling natural language variations and ensuring real-time database performance. To address these:
- We enhanced our training data in Dialogflow by adding more diverse examples, which improved intent recognition accuracy.
- We optimized our database queries and used indexing to ensure quick response times, even with large datasets."

### 7. Conclusion and Future Work
 our eCommerce chatbot leverages cutting-edge technologies to provide a seamless and efficient shopping experience for users. Moving forward, we plan to:
- Integrate personalized recommendations based on user behavior and past purchases.
- Expand the chatbot’s availability to more platforms, including social media channels and mobile apps.
- Continuously improve the chatbot’s natural language understanding capabilities to better serve our users."
